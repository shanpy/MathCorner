Summary: I wrote this reading note for 2016 CFA Program Curriculum Level 1 - Reading 5 *The Time Value of Money*. This reading session belongs to **Study Session 2 - Quantitative Methods/Basic Concepts**, which introduces several tools of quantitative analysis: time value of money, descriptive statistics, and probability. This reading notes also includes some Chinese translations and extra knowledges(may in Chinese) for some terminologies.

###Part 2: Interest Rates: Interpretation

Time value of money concerns **equivalence relationships** between **cash flows** occurring on different dates.

*If you pay $ 10,000 one year from today and in return receive $ 9,500 today, this can be a fair trade because you **discount** the $ 10,000 received in one year. i.e. **cutting** its values based on how much times passes before the money is paid.*
