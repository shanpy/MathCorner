            "text":"[TOC] One of my goal for 2015 is to learn Python. To prepare for this, I decided to create a new blog site, based on Python. After doing some research, I decide to use Nikola to build my blog. One of the reason I choose Nikola is that it has great support to IPython Notebook. Lots of Thanks to Damian Avila! Your blog is so useful and great for Nikola beginners like me! 1. Create Virtual Environment Before you install Nikola, a good practice is to build a virual environment. You can install Virtualenv and use it. Since I had Anaconda installed, I just type conda create -n techblog python=3.4 anaconda to create a virtual environment called “techblog” with python 3.4. You can define your own name and python version. 2. Install Nikola and Necessary Component First, make sure you use your virtual enviorment. command is: source activate name_of_environment I suggest you to use pip to install followiing components: - nikola - requests - sphinx - pyzmq - tornado(?) - jinja2 - webassets (if you want to use USE_BUNDLES) - markdown (if you want to use markdown) - ipython (if you want to use ipython notebook) For example, you type follwing command in your terminal: pip install nikola requests sphinx markdown ipython pyzmq tornado jinja2 webasset In the next following steps, make sure you are under your virtual environment. 3. Initialize Nikola Type nikola init in your terminal, where you want to build your site in a subfolder of current location. You will be asked following questions: - Destination: Name of the folder your site will be - Site Title - Site Author - Author’s Email - Site Description - Site URL: This is the url that when you click header of your site, the page will jump to. You can set this later in conf.py file. If you type one, make sure it ends with a /. - Default Language: I use en but you can refer Nikola website for more option. - Time Zone: Short name for your time zone. I use EST. For example. - Comment System: Nikola support popular comment system such as Disqus, Google+ and Facebook. You will be asked to enter comment system site identifier if required. 4. Change Theme (Optional) If you want to change theme of your website, You can find a list of themes from Nikiola Website. Note any theme that has ipython in its name supports IPython Notebook. Then, do cd your_folder to get to the folder that Nikola just created for you. Type nikola install_theme name_of_theme to install theme. You may need to change some setting in conf.py file, so read instructions in your terminal carefully. 5. Configure and Build Site First, open conf.py file and configure it as your requests: If you didn’t do some setup in step 3 in terminal, you can found them here. For example, you can re-edit SITE_URL if you haven’t done so. If you have installed new theme and want to change to it, change THEME= option to your installed theme. Some theme may also want you to change NAVIGATION_LINKS or other settings. If you want to use IPython Notebook or Markdown, find POSTS = option and add (&#34;posts/*.md&#34;, &#34;posts&#34;, &#34;post.tmpl&#34;),(&#34;posts/*.ipynb&#34;, &#34;posts&#34;, &#34;post.tmpl&#34;),. If you don’t need lots of new pages, I suggest you not change PAGES setting. Set INDEX_TEASERS = to True to enable teaser. Now you can just put .. TEASER_END or &lt;!--TEASER_END--&gt; in your post to make index page only show first part of your post If you have installed webassets, you can set USE_BUNDLES= to True to speed up your site. I skip the process of creating new post. Note if you create a IPython Notebook post, you can edit information such as slugs, dates, tags in .meta file, which is automatically generated with .ipynb file. Now you can type nikola build to build your site. A list of rendered file will appear. What user can see from your website is in output folder. If you have any external file, such as PDF or IMAGE, you can put it in files folder. After building, you can type nikola serve to host your site locally. By default, you site can be open from http://localhost:8000/ 6. Deploy Site to Github Pages I find great help from solution of Damian’s blog. I used his method to deploy this site to one of my Github page. Please make sure you do follwing steps except git initiate every time you want to make change: First, create a repository. You can use default “user.github.io” repo, but since I prefer a project Github Page, so I create a repo called “techblog”. After installed Git to your machine, cd to your site folder, then type git init to initiate. Do git remote add origin https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repo.git to add repo, with a name origin. Push all of your content to master branch first Do git checkout -b gh-pages to create and swich to gh-pages. You can skip -b after you do this once. Do git rm -rf . Do git commit -am &#34;Your Commit&#34; to commit for gh-pages Do git push origin gh-pages Do git checkout master to switch back to master branch Do git branch -D gh-pages first to avoid commit error. (I tried to skip this step before but I got a git commit error, so I suggest you do this step first) Do git subtree split --prefix output -b gh-pages to only transfer content in output folder from master to gh-pages Do git push -f origin gh-pages:gh-pages to force push Do git branch -D gh-pages again to delete local gh-pages branch 7. Add Custom Domain to Your Github Page (Optional) You may want to add custom domain to your Github page. Github has a tutorial here. Since I’m hosting my domain (pengyin-shan.com) on GoDaddy, I followed instructions in this blog. A few things I want to mention: CNAME file should be put to your files folder so that when you following steps above to push to Github, this file will show in gh-pages branch. The content of CNAME file should be bare subdomain of your custom domain, which means you can not use http://test.com or http:test.com/blog. You can only have one custdom domain. I think based on Github’s role, even though you are hosting project Github pages, your custom domain has to be “test.com” instead of “test.com/name_of_repo” On Jan 1st, 2015, the IP address of Github Project Page are 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.152.154. If you have A (Host), make sure your @ is pointing to these two IPs. If you finish these settings, you should be able to host your Nikola blog on Github Page. Please feel free to let me know if you have any comments.",

Same as what’s happening in terminal, &lt;tab&gt; button in IPython can do auto-complete. object introspection: ?variable_name in IPython can provide information about this variable: function_name?? will show this function’s source code if exists. *name* is wildcard operation. It can list result that is combined by ‘XXnameX’ or ‘nameXXX’ %paste and %cpaste can takes code on clipboard then execute it in a single block in the shell magic command: It is prefixed by the percentage symbol %",

            "text":"[TOC] Recentely I read a great article about Hosting IPython Notebook on Amazon AWS Free Tier from Scratch. This tutorial explains the way to host IPython Notebook using a Amazon EC2 Micro Instance. I followed this tutorial and successfully hosted an IPython notebook on a Ubuntu 14 Guest AMI. I want to record some of important steps I took while following this tutorial: Note: You can use nano to edit ipython_notebook_config.py file. It is located at ~/.ipython/profile_nbserver/. Security Group When you set up rules for Security Groups, make sure you include SSH, HTTPS and 8888 all of these. Lack of one can make your IPython Notebook fail. If you forget to do so when you set up the machine, you can set up later in your EC2 management console. Elastic Ip The tutorial suggest you link an Elastic IP to your instance so that everytime you try to access your instance in browser, you can type new ip address instead of long public DNS. To do this, click Elastic IPs option in you EC2 Dashboard menu, which is in NETWORK &amp; SECURITY section. On right panel, click Allocate New Address button. Then click Yes in the pop-up window. Now a IP address should be generated. Rememeber to associate your instance with this IP address. Select this IP address, then click Associate Address button. A pop-up window will appear. Click Instance then select your instance in drop-dowm menu. You can also do other setting here. Click Associate to associate your instance to this IP. Now you just need to type: https://your_elastic_ip:port_number to your IPython Notebook. Make IPython Run as Service You may want you IPython notebook still works after you shutdown your terminal/SSH. I got solution from this StackOverflow post. I got screen by typing sudo apt-get install screen, then do ipython server &amp;. If this not work for you, try screen ipython s instead",
